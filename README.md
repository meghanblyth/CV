## <h1>Meghan Blyth</h1> 

I am full-stack junior software developer and a recent graduate of the Makers Academy Bootcamp. During my previous twenty year career in the performing arts industry, I have worked as a performer, choreographer, teacher, director and producer. Working in the performing arts has allowed me to become a highly solution orientated, ambitious and organised person, who is accustomed to delivering high quality work performances on time. I am excited to transfer my creative, interpersonal and professional skills to the constantly evolving tech industry, where I can learn new languages and frameworks in order to improve and succeed as a developer.
