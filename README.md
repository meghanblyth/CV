## <h1>Meghan Blyth</h1> 

I am full-stack junior software developer and a recent graduate of the Makers Academy Bootcamp. During my previous twenty year career in the performing arts industry, I have worked as a performer, choreographer, teacher, director and producer. Working in the performing arts has allowed me to become a highly solution orientated, ambitious and organised person, who is accustomed to delivering high quality work performances on time. I am excited to transfer my creative, interpersonal and professional skills to the constantly evolving tech industry, where I can learn new languages and frameworks in order to improve and succeed as a developer.

## Skills

#### Organisation and planning

My career to date has involved planning and executing productions involving large technical teams and performance casts of over one hundred children, teens and adults. I have produced many shows and events and have planned and arranged multiple performance trips for groups of over forty nationally and internationally. Planning productions and performance trips requires highly skilled organisation ability, as well as the ability to adapt to any unexpected changes and replan accordingly. 

#### Solution orientated 

Thanks to over twenty years working in theatres, on productions and in studios with performers of all ages, I have developed a solution orientated approach to all challenges.  Working in performing arts comes with frequent unexpected challenges, which often require urgent attention and reconsiliation. I have become adept at dealing with issues in a calm, timely and solution orientated manner. 

#### Excellent communicator 

Whether working with toddlers at a studio, performers at an event or technical teams at a theatre, having a career in the performing arts industry requires clear, consistent and positive communication. While exciting and wonderful, performing and rehearsing can sometimes be a high pressure environment, which requires open communication as well as organisation in order for everyone to acheive their best. I have developed excellent communicating skills during my years working in theatres, with students and with fellow colleagues. 


#### Quick learner 

Years of experience working on productions and in a studio setting have taught me that a quick mind can master any skill. From costume repair to music editing, there are no skills off limits when working against the clock in the performing arts industry. I have enjoyed adding to my skill set over the past eighteen months as I have embarked on a Masters degree and then the Makers Academy bootcamp. I have come to recognise that software development and performing arts have a lot of overlap, particularly when it comes to learning new skills quickly, and how important it is to take initiative and engage in self directed learning for both careers.
